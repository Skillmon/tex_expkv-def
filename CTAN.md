This provides a key=val frontend to define keys for
[`expkv`](https://github.com/Skillmon/tex_expkv). It is generic code and only
requires `expkv` for its parsing. There is a LaTeX package `expkv-def.sty`
included to play nice on LaTeX's package loading system, but that package is not
needed and does not provide more functionality than the generic code in
`expkv-def.tex`.
